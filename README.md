# Story
## COVID-19:  How does the state of Minnesota compare?
I began a bootcamp in March 2020. In an attempt to understand the data being presented hourly it seemed, for our first project my group used Minnesota as a focal point. Contained here is a snapshot of the pandemic in April of that year. Much was still unknown. "Wash your hands" was the prevailing advice from the CDC.

# Comparitive Analysis
Looking to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the state of Minnesota based on the following criteria: Total Population, Testing, Hospitalization, and Death Rate.

   * Minnesota versus National.
   * Minnesota versus a similar size state population.
   * Minnesota population center density versus another states similar population center. To be defined as a comparitive city/county versus similar population state city/county. We have chosen Hennepin and Ramsey counties which contain the cities of Minneapolis and St.Paul.

# Data Sources
   * The COVID Tracking Project. Import national and state historical data related 
        to the United States population summary information for national and state(s) 
        COVID-19 testing, hospitalization, and death rates.
        https://covidtracking.com/data

   * Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. Import current data for counties comparitive
        analysis of COVID Tracking Project data. Focus on a sample population comparison 
        for a area of similar counties population density. Exmaple: MN Hennepin & Ramsey.

   *  United States Census Bureau. Import state and county population data for sizing 
        comparision of national, state, and county COVID-19 analysis using 2018 estimates.

# Project Responsibility Breakdown
* Define Title and Objectives. What is your story? (Team)
  * Determine similar State and City/County/Metro Area to compare against (Ian Mac).
  * Just similar pop county, look at County area for density. If none, extrapolation down to county from State totals based on confirmed cases and deaths?
  * Research source for county testing and hospitalization data.
  * Do we want history for County data? Would need to compile from Johns Hopkins files
* Determine data sources. (Team)
* Jupyter Notebook data API exploration, build, and clean up. (Phil and Ian)
  * Bring in DataFrames from Covid Tracking, JHU, Census, summarys, for MN, National (Phil)
  * Clone JHU repo into ours? (Phil)
* Matplotlib data visualizations (6 to 8 visualizations). (Team)
  * Determine chart types and visualization methods. 
  * Play with charting. (Rob)
  * Create and save charts as PNGs to Output_data folder. (Team)
* Project Readme. (Rob)
* Data Visualization Project Tracker Update. (Rob)
* PowerPoint Presentation and Write Up of conclusions? (Team)
