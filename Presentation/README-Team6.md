# Story
COVID-19:  How does the state of Minnesota compare?

# Comparitive Analysis
Looking to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the state of Minnesota based on the following criteria: Total Population, Testing, Hospitalization, and Death Rate.

   * Minnesota versus National.
   * Minnesota versus a similar size state population.
   * Minnesota population center density versus another states similar population center. To be defined as a comparitive city/county versus similar population state city/county. We have chosen Hennepin and Ramsey counties which contain the cities of Minneapolis and St.Paul.

# Data Sources
   * The COVID Tracking Project. Import national and state historical data related 
        to the United States population summary information for national and state(s) 
        COVID-19 testing, hospitalization, and death rates.
        https://covidtracking.com/data

   * Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. Import current data for counties comparitive
        analysis of COVID Tracking Project data. Focus on a sample population comparison 
        for a area of similar counties population density. Exmaple: MN Hennepin & Ramsey.

   *  United States Census Bureau. Import state and county population data for sizing 
        comparision of national, state, and county COVID-19 analysis using 2018 estimates.

# Project Requirements
Development Technical Requirements:
* Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the ﬁnal data analysis. 
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
* (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can ﬁnd an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
* Create a write-up summarizing your major ﬁndings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your ﬁndings and any relevant plots.

Presentation Requirements:
* Prepare a formal ten-minute presentation that presents:
* Questions found interesting and what motivated you to investigate and answer them?
* Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions?
* The data exploration and clean up process accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook.
* The analysis process accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook.
* Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary.
* The implications of your findings? What do your findings mean?

# Data Visualization Project Tracker
* Define Title and Objectives. What is your story? (Team)
  * Determine similar State and City/County/Metro Area to compare against (Ian Mac).
  * Just similar pop county, look at County area for density. If none, extrapolation down to county from State totals based on confirmed cases and deaths?
  * Research source for county testing and hospitalization data.
  * Do we want history for County data? Would need to compile from Johns Hopkins files
* Determine data sources. (Team)
* Jupyter Notebook data API exploration, build, and clean up. (Phil and Ian)
  * Bring in DataFrames from Covid Tracking, JHU, Census, summarys, for MN, National (Phil)
  * Clone JHU repo into ours? (Phil)
* Matplotlib data visualizations (6 to 8 visualizations). (Team)
  * Determine chart types and visualization methods. 
  * Play with charting. (Rob)
  * Create and save charts as PNGs to Output_data folder. (Team)
* Project Readme. (Rob)
* Data Visualization Project Tracker Update. (Rob)
* PowerPoint Presentation and Write Up of conclusions? (Team)
* Link to Data Visualization Project Tracker: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gb29HR5fH3w32Zrm048jqC98u5iTM9oXEJnK2tX-aSE/edit#gid=2041823604
